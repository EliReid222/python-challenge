For this challenge I was tasked with creating a code using Python to simplify data given. This python challenge actually included two very different sets of data that needed to be analysed. The data given was based off large datasets that included election results and budget data. With the code created I was able to conduct a financial analysis of the budget that identified the total months, the entire amount of the budget, the average change in budget per month, the greatest increase in profits per month and lastly the greatest decrease in profits per month. The second dataset included election results where I listed the total votes in the entire data set, listed the winners, the percentage each candidate recieved, and also determined the winner. I used many different methods with python learned in class to get the desired outcome with both data sets.
